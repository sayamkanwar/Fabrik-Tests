## 3. Identifying application entry point

I fetched the 'csrftoken' from /accounts/login/ from the csrf token cookie and inspected the source code of /accounts/login/ for the value of 'csrfmiddlewaretoken'.

COMMAND
```
curl -v --cookie "csrftoken=E6b3FaVLMrVahxVyeJYmTy8yQyxMe1c5OCLceu0T54sWFaLSHT8WwUWTrQTSwAsW" --data "csrfmiddlewaretoken=dwmoCtxiIFeEveNYoTXPj2nfn1cNDiYbn2WxbNCq1iLqTRDiR37pWobAYjyTVRe2&login=sk&password=PASSWORD" http://0.0.0.0:8000/accounts/login/
```

OUTPUT

```

## 4. Identifying open ports

COMMAND
```
nmap -p 8000 --open 0.0.0.0
```

OUTPUT

```
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-11-16 03:46 IST

Host is up (0.00019s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.13 seconds
```

## 5. Checking for Certificate information, Weak Ciphers and SSL

COMMAND
```
nmap --script ssl-cert,ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443,465,993,995 0.0.0.0
```

OUTPUT

```
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-11-16 04:04 IST

## 6. SQL Injection

I entered the username 'sk' as it was already registered and in the password field, I entered `` ' OR 1=1 -- ``.

OUTPUT

```
The username and/or password you specified are not correct.
```

I tried entering `` ') OR 1=1 -- `` to check if there was any encryption function called but it didn't work too.
